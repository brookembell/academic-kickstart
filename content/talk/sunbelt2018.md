abstract = "Background: Social networks are an important source of influence on food intake and obesity risk, yet are rarely the focus of obesity interventions. Social network characteristics likely to be important to the adoption and maintenance of a healthy weight and energy balance behaviors include: social isolation, because social connections provide support and resources needed to engage in healthy behaviors; and weight and behavior norms, because social connections are a source of influence via several mechanisms (e.g., normative influence, mimicry). There is growing emphasis on preventing obesity in the first two years of life, targeting mothers and families to prevent excess weight gain during early childhood. Parent feeding practices, and eating and activity habits, have an immense and lasting influence on obesity risk in children. These families are embedded in social networks and communities that influence their health behaviors. Objectives: This study builds upon a childhood obesity prevention program called COPE (Childhood Obesity Prevention at homE), which is a new, add-on module for existing Home Visitation Programs (HVPs). HVPs provide in-home services to low-income mothers and their infants across the U.S.; a population with health and obesity disparities. Specifically, this 6-month pilot study assessed if mothers’ social network characteristics were related to the focal outcomes of the COPE intervention (mother diet, weight status; infant diet, weight trajectory), and tested if social network characteristics moderated the intervention effects. Methods: Fifty mothers and infants (70% Hispanic/Latino) were recruited through our community HVP partner and randomized to receive (1) the HVP core curriculum only or (2) the HVP core curriculum + COPE module, for six months. Assessments, conducted at baseline and post-intervention included: (1) mothers’ egocentric network characteristics, (2) mother/infant food intake, and (3) mothers’ postpartum weight retention and children’s growth velocity. Regression models were used to identify social network characteristics that predicted mother and infant outcomes, controlling for mother demographics and study arm. Results: Several features of mothers’ social networks were significantly associated with the intervention outcomes. Mothers had significantly lower intake of sugary beverages post-intervention if they had a smaller proportion of friends in their network (b = .53, p = .005). Post-intervention, mothers had greater intake of fruit if their network had lower density at baseline (b = -.703, p = .001), and they had greater intake of vegetables if they had a greater proportion of alters that encouraged them to be healthy at baseline (b = .483, p = .020). For infants, two features of mothers’ social networks predicted lower intake of sugary beverages post-intervention: a smaller proportion of alters they had contact with daily/almost daily (b = .602, p = .001), and a smaller proportion of alters that lived in the same household or neighborhood (b = .507, p = .004). Overall, these findings suggest that family-based obesity interventions should consider the social networks in which families are embedded, and develop appropriate strategies to foster social connections that provide support and healthy social influence, to bolster healthy behavior and weight outcomes."
