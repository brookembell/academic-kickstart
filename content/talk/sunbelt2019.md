abstract = "Background: To address the public health epidemic of tobacco smoking, the World Health Organization (WHO) Member States negotiated and unanimously adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), an international treaty aimed at reducing tobacco use. Throughout the negotiation and ratification process, an online forum for communication and information exchange about tobacco control, called the GLOBALink (GL) network, was available to anti-tobacco control advocates representing the 193 participating countries. The purpose of this online network was to assist in facilitating the adoption of the FCTC treaty. Previous research has shown that a country’s likelihood of either signing or adopting an international treaty can be directly associated at various levels with peer effects and political signaling in both political and economic networks. Moreover, in the case of the FCTC treaty, earlier analyses provide evidence indicating that higher levels of exposure to countries adopting the framework had a positive and significant effect in the likelihood of a country adopting the FCTC. In this presentation, we will show new research analyzing country-level network influences on another WHO treaty, a non-tobacco-related “comparison treaty”, that addresses the lowering of worldwide pollution levels (POLLUTE). These two treaties have spread internationally over similar time periods and at approximately the same rate. We hypothesize that social networks arising from GL influenced FCTC adoption, whereas other non-GL networks (e.g., international communication and trade networks) did not. Additionally, we hypothesize that these other non-GL networks will be associated with adoption of the other treaty, but will not be associated with FCTC adoption. Methods: Using GL networks, and in particular: (1) GL interest group co-subscriptions, (2) GL membership referrals, and (3) GL communication networks, and non-GL networks, including: (1) international trade, (2) international of trade of tobacco-related products, (3) international communication, (4) geographical proximity between countries, and (5) bilateral aid-flow networks, we calculated exposure levels with respect to the adoption of the two aforementioned treaties (FCTC and POLLUTE), which we then used to estimate lagged logistic regressions models in order to measure the effect size (if any) of exposure over adoption rates, i.e., a network diffusion model. Results: Network lagged exposure effects were significant for the geographic proximity network (AOR=0.0004, p<0.01) in terms of estimating likelihood of FCTC adoption. For the adoption of the POLLUTE treaty, the geographic proximity network (AOR=0.003, p<0.01) and GL interest group co-membership network (AOR=0.2, p<0.05) showed significant exposure effects. Conclusion: These findings do not support our primary hypothesis that the GL networks were associated with FCTC adoption. Higher exposure via the geographic proximity network (i.e., countries closer in distance), however, did have a significant negative effect on the adoption of the FCTC and POLLUTE treaties. Despite null findings, this study utilizes a unique longitudinal dataset containing passive measures of multiple “behaviors” (treaties) and multiple networks, and provides a comparison and contrast of treaty exposures not typically available in international relations studies."
