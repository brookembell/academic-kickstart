summary = "M2FED proposes an integrated system of in-home beacons, wireless and wearable sensors, and smartphones that provide ongoing, synchronized real-time data on in-home eating behaviors and theory-based process variables.
This rich data will be aggregated to generate real-time contextual FED models using systems networks models. Key activities that precede target behaviors will be identified in order to develop and optimize future just-in-time, adaptive interventions."
