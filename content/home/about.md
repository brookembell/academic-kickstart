# Biography

Brooke Bell is a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Health Behavior Research Ph.D. program at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. She graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Southern California in 2016. Brooke currently works on research that utilizes mobile health technologies and sensors to understand how social processes and systems affect obesity-related health behaviors in children and families.

She is also broadly interested in health and food policy, food systems, climate change, and sustainability. In future years, she plans to investigate the impact of climate change on eating behaviors, food systems, chronic disease risk, and health outcomes. Moreover, she would like to engage in research on how food systems can be leveraged and transformed to encourage individual-level eating behaviors that both improve chronic disease outcomes and help mitigate climate change and its subsequent effects on human health.
