# Biography

I am currently a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Health Behavior Research Ph.D. program at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. I previously graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Southern California in 2016. My doctoral dissertation research utilizes mobile health technologies and sensors to understand how social processes and systems affect obesity-related health behaviors in children and families.

I am broadly interested in health and food policy, food systems, climate change, and sustainability. In future years, I plan to investigate the impact of climate change on eating behaviors, food systems, chronic disease risk, and health outcomes. I'd also like to engage in research examining how food systems can be leveraged and transformed to encourage individual-level eating behaviors that both improve chronic disease outcomes and help mitigate climate change and its subsequent effects on human health. 

I will be joining the Yale School of Public Health and the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center as Postdoctoral Fellow in May 2021.
